This C program displays calendars for the Gregorian calendar, either for a specific month or for an entire year. The code includes functions to compute the starting weekday of a month and to print the calendar layout. 
The get_1st_weekday function calculates the weekday of the first day of a given year, while print_month_calendar and print_year_calendar handle the printing of monthly and yearly calendars, respectively. To use the program, compile with gcc -o calendar calendar.c and run with ./calendar. Follow the on-screen prompts to select the year and month for which you want to print the calendar. The program supports calendar printing with correct alignment and formatting for readability.
